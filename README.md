# Pythonic
Your script will contain no more than two lines of code. You must print the multiples of 7 in the range \[7, 350\], separated by a hypen (-).

## Hints
- A list comprehension will be necessary.
- Recall that placing `*` in front of an iterable type will return all the elements as individual variables.
- For an extra challenge (but no extra points this time ☹️), try to do it in one line.

## Remember
- Name your file wsuid\_lab07.cpp
- You are now required to include a comment block at the top of the file. See the Coding Guidelines handout.
